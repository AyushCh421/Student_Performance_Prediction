# Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts student performance using Linear Regression in Python. 
It uses academic scores (including math score) and demographic features to forecast overall performance. 
Feature scaling and preprocessing were applied to improve accuracy.

# KEY FEATURES
- Data preprocessing: scaling numeric features, handling categorical data
- Linear Regression modeling
- Evaluation metrics: R², MSE, RMSE, MAE, cross-validation
- Visualization: residual plots and predicted vs actual comparisons

**#MARKDOWN**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| R²     | 0.940 |
| MSE    | 12.02 |
| RMSE   | 3.46  |
| MAE    | 2.77  |
| Cross-validated R² | 0.939 |

**#TOOLS AND LIBRARIES**
- Python 3
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn**
